This project was made to let school students evade the censorship put in place by schools.

## Tech Stack

## Why this exists

I got much of the inspiration for this project from [TitaniumNetwork](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev), a group that is known for making proxies, proxy frameworks, etc. I wanted to create my own forum for people to discuss proxies, chromebook exploits, etc.

## Notice

I would recommend not selfhosting this since the original version has the most members. Use the instance hosted by [yeetsquad747](https://github.com/yeetsquad747) at [exploitcb.errorcodezero.live](https://exploitcb.errorcodezero.live).
